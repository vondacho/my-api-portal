Feature: API specification onboarding
  As the API portal
  I want to register and upgrade API specifications through the RegistrationService
  So that only valid and scored specifications enter the registry

  Background:
    Given the registry holds no prior specification

  Scenario: A valid and scored OpenAPI candidate is registered
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_petstore_v1.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding succeeds
    And the specification id is spec-123
    And the specification version is v1
    And the contract is OPENAPI_V30
    And a scorecard is assigned with global score of 74
    And the specification status is REGISTERED
    And the specification body contains "x-score"
    And registered spec-123 named "petstore" in "platform" at v1 1.0.0

  Scenario: A valid and scored AsyncAPI candidate is registered
    When the candidate "e2e/asyncapi_v30_notification_v1.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding succeeds
    And the specification status is REGISTERED
    And the specification id is spec-123
    And the specification version is v1
    And the contract is ASYNCAPI_V30
    And a scorecard is assigned with global score of 74
    And registered spec-123 named "notification" in "platform" at v1 1.0.0

  Scenario: A candidate missing required info is not onboarded
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_missing_required_info.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding fails
    And a violation MISSING_DATA is reported

  Scenario: A candidate having a malformed version is not onboarded
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_malformed_version.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding fails
    And a violation MALFORMED_VERSION is reported

  Scenario: A candidate missing required metadata is not onboarded

  Scenario: A candidate missing non-mandatory info is onboarded
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_missing_non_required_info.yaml" is submitted

    And the specification status is REGISTERED
    And no violation reported

  Scenario: A candidate missing non-mandatory metadata is onboarded

    Then the onboarding succeeds
    And the specification status is REGISTERED
    And no violation reported

  Scenario: A valid candidate scored under the minimal threshold is not onboarded
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_under_minimal_scoring_threshold.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding fails
    And a violation INSUFFICIENT_SCORING is reported

  Scenario: A valid candidate is not registered when the scorer is not available
    Given the scorer cannot score specifications
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_petstore_v1.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding succeeds
    And the specification status is VALID
    And no specification id is assigned
    And no scorecard is assigned
    And a warning DEPENDENCY_NOT_AVAILABLE is reported

  Scenario: A valid candidate is not registered when the registry is not available
    Given the registry cannot register specifications
    When the candidate "e2e/openapi_v30_petstore_v1.yaml" is submitted
    Then the onboarding succeeds
    And the specification status is SCORED
    And no specification id is assigned

    And the specification revision is 1.0.0
    And the audit contains "candidate onboarded" on 2026-07-01
    And registered spec-123 named "petstore" in "platform" at v1 1.0.0

  Scenario: An update on a registered specification creates a new revision

    Given the registry holds spec-456 named "petstore" in "platform" at v1 1.0.0

    Then the scoring succeeds
    And the specification id is spec-456
